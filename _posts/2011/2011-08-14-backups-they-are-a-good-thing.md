Just had a HDD failure on my server which took out my website. It seems like there was also an issue with the RAID setup as the restore returned the drive to an old image. Good thing I had a recent backup from which the site could be restored.

The site is backup with just a few comments missing. I was fortunately able to grab them from Google cache and manually enter them back into the database.
