Over the last week I have posted a series of entries about how to execute custom tasks as part of a build process without TFS. The result of this process is the [Neovolve.BuildTaskExecutor 1.0][0] application which is now available on Codeplex.

The following posts document how BuildTaskExecutor has come about:

* [Executing build tasks without a build server – Design][1]
* [Executing build tasks without a build server – Implementation][2]
* [Executing build tasks without a build server – In action][3]
* [Executing build tasks without a build server – Example scenario][4]
* [Executing build tasks without a build server – Creating a custom ITask][5]

You can download Neovolve.BuildTaskExecutor from [here][0].

Enjoy.
