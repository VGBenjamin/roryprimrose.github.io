I had a bit of a slipup yesterday. I had a set of changes that I was relating to two different work items. I realised that I really should split up the check-in into two check-ins so that the code files are better related to their work items. What I didn't do before checking in both changesets was updating the comments of the check-ins before I committed them.

After realising my mistake, I wondered if I could change the comment of a changeset. Thankfully the answer is yes. After finding the changesets by looking at the history in TFS, I was able to simply adjust the comment to be more appropriate to the changeset and click Save. Simple.
