I've been on ADSL2+ for a few years now. Having a possible maximum speed of 24Gb is nice, but the actual floats between 5-7Gb being 3.5km from the exchange. That's not great, but is fast enough for general net usage. Tonight however, surfing the net has been slow. Really really slow. So slow in fact, that [www.speedtest.net][0] tells me this.

In the test before this one, the upload speed was actually a tad faster than the download speed. Did someone say broadband??? 

Yep, I'm glad that broadband in this country is so fast. My sarcasm drips all the way from this post to [this article][2]. Broadband in this country is a disgrace which is a real shame. 

**Update:**

This morning is better :)
