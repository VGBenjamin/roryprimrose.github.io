I did a grading on the weekend with a few other students of my Taekwondo club. We started with some kicking and punching for a warm-up. The two beginners who were grading displayed their patterns. Myself and two other red belts then did the advanced patterns (Chil Jang and Pal Jang) followed by the first black belt pattern (Koryo). Patterns were followed by 3 and 1 step sparring which is always quite a bit to get your head around in a grading! This was all topped off with some board breaking (three for me).

The grading went really well and I was very happy with my performance. I am now a Cho Dan Bo.
