 This is basically a reminder post, but you might find it useful. 

 In the development I have been doing in the last few months, I have been doing a lot of config based assembly loading. Trying to find out why an assembly doesn't load can be very difficult though. Check out [Suzanne Cook's post][0] about fuslogvw.exe.
