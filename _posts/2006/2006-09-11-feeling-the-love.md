I just got a comment that I hadn't posted about my first week in the new job and how great the people are here (People read my blog???). Well, this one's for you [Pants][0].

I've just started my second week. Last week I was introduced to a ton of great people. I experienced some desk hopping and the varied accuracy skills that people have with small soft balls. As [mentioned previous][1], I have also been very privileged to be able to do some work with WPF which is a whole world of fun. Unfortunately I don't have access to IM or GMail though (so no AusDotNet [:(]).
