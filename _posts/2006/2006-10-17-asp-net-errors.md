Sorry people. This is just a note to myself because every few months I come across the same problems with a new development build.

**Failed to access IIS metabase:**

aspnet_regiis -i

**Mutex Could not be Created:**

I have got the same issue. It seems like Visual studio 2005 and the web application pool running ASP.NET 2.0 are having a conflict over the temporary folder.  

The workaround I have got for now is:  

- If you have visual studio 2005 is open, close it  
- Go to the ASP.NET temporary folder for v2.0 of the framework  
 &lt;Windows dir&gt;\Microsoft.Net\Framework\v2.0&lt;extra numbers&gt;\Temporary ASPNET pages  
- Remove the folder for your application (or all of them)  
- Reset IIS (on a command line window, iisreset) [not always needed, but I had to use it sometimes]  
- First Browse your page from IE (http://localhost/your app)  
- Then reopen Visual studio
