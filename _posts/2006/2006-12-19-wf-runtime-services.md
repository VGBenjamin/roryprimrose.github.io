I have been looking at WF runtime services, specifically the [ManualWorkflowSchedulerService][0] for running workflows synchronously. In my research travels this morning, I came across [this article][1] on the [odetocode][2] site. At a quick read, it seems like [Scott Allen][3] has put together a fantastic article with just the right about of information, code and detail.
