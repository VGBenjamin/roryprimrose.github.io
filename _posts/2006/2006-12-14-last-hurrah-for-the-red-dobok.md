Given my impending fatherhood, there have to be changes and sacrifices. I have been instructing beginners and intermediates at Taekwondo for about a year and a half. Tonight was the last night for me as an instructor so I have to give up the cool "go faster" intermediate instructor's red [dobok][0]. Pity, I liked that one.
