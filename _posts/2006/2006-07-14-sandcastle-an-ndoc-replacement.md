 NDoc has been a valuable tool for many years. Unfortunately, like many 3rd party free software projects, it is hard to publish version after version for a market that has time to use it, but a developer that doesn't have time to develop it (I feel your pain Kevin!). As much as I would like to see NDoc mature to the 2.0 framework, it looks like Microsoft are finally going to roll their own project. Read about SandCastle [here][0] and [here][1]. It should be released as a CTP soon. 

 Thanks to [Dwight][2] for originally pointing me to [this][3] forum post.
