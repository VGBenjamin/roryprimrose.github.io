I haven't done much [training][0] this year. We were in New Zealand for January, and for the last two months, I have helped with instructing on many of the nights that I would normally train. This has been because I was either a little sick and couldn't train or other instructors couldn't make it.

This weekend was the first decent training session that I have had this year. It was fantastic to do a decent workout and practise my patterns and sparring. 

I am going to train with the advanced class now which should be really good as I will get more training per week than I have had previously. Really looking forward to it. This should also help me grade the next few levels very quickly as well. I hope to get to ChoDanBo (trial black belt) by the middle of the year.
