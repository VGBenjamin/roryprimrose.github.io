 This morning I have been reading through Applications = Code + Markup by [Charles Petzold][1]. It is a good read with lots of details. I have found a small misprint though. Page x (as in page 10 of the introduction) says that the codes samples can be found at [http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/companion/6-1957-3][2]. This appears to be incorrect. The url to use is [http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/companion/**0-735**6-1957-3/][3].
