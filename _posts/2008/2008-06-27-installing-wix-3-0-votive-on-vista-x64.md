Here's a tip for young players. You may find that getting the latest WiX 3.0 beta from [here][0] gives you an error saying that you need to have a version of Visual Studio installed that is above the Express edition. I have Team Suite installed, so it should be a problem. 

After lots of research, I came across [this post][1] which gave me the answer. It wasn't a problem with the version of Visual Studio that I had installed, it was because latest build published on the [SourceForge download][2] page was prior to their support of x64 systems. After downloading the latest build published [here][3], it's all good.
