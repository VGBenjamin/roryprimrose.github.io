I had a conversation yesterday regarding WCF service contract design with my tech lead at work. Funnily enough, I then got a comment on an [old post][0] that afternoon from Ciaran O'Neill which is really about the same topic. I thought that I should write up my thoughts on the subject. See [here][1] for the article.
