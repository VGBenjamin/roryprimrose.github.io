I came up with a new term today - _scope sneak_. 

[Sneak][0] \[sneek\]: verb, sneaked or snuck, sneak·ing, noun 

> –verb (used without object) 

> 1. to go in a stealthy or furtive manner; slink; skulk.
> 1. to act in a furtive or underhand way.
> 1. British Informal. to tattle; inform.

Something happened at work today when a friend highlighted that some requirements had been snuck into a requirements document he was developing from. It occurred to me that this isn't really [scope creep][1] (also seen [here][2]). Scope creep to me implies that everyone on the project knows that requirements are being added or changed (usually expanded). This situation was a bit more like requirements were added on the sly, hence _scope sneak_.
