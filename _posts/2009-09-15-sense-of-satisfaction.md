I just found out that something I came up with a few years ago in another job has hit production and is making a big difference. There were a lot of people involved in supporting the idea and some innovators who took the concept and applied it in ways I didn’t think of. Overall it is a great result and I’m very happy to see such a change being applied.![seal][0]
