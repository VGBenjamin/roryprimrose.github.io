 My wife and I started doing TaeKwonDo about six months ago and it has been a lot of fun doing it together. After only three weeks, we were able to do a triple grading to take us from White belt to Orange three tip. Since then we have done a double grading to go to Yellow two tip. The next grading is in a week or so. We will be able to go to Yellow three tip, or maybe double grade again to get to Green belt. 

 I have now been asked if I want to become an instructor. After several weeks thinking about whether I would be able to fit it in, I am going to give it a go.
