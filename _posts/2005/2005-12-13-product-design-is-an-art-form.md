 I don't think that I am very easy to please when it comes to products and customer service. It generally takes a lot for me to experience the 'wow' factor. 

 From a product point of view, the things that I like tend to be really complex (like computers) or look really cool (like a really sweet GUI design or website). I think that what this comes down to is that consumers are expecting more bang for their buck as technology has progressed. As for customer service, I think the 'wow' factor usually can't be found. [This isn't always the case][0], but customer service is seriously flawed in today's commercial world. 

 Every now and then though, I really get a kick out of simple designs. Take [this][1] for example. What a fantastic, yet very simple idea. For me, I think this product is up there with the loop design on power cable plugs so you can loop your finger through the plug rather than pulling on the cord. 

 Waiting for the next 'wow'...
