I have just tried to view some [XBAP applications][0] using RC1 of [NetFx]. Unfortunately it didn't go so well because I am sitting behind a proxy server. IE has it's connection settings defined for how to go through the proxy, but it seems that the XBAP host isn't doing the same. I am getting this error:

> _System.Net.WebException: The remote server returned an error: (407) Proxy Authentication Required._

I have found some references (such as [here][1] and [here][2]) which mention changes to the machine.config, but this hasn't solved the problem. Has anyone been able to get around this problem?
