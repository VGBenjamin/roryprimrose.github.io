I have received an email report from TFS for a nightly team build that I have set up. The build ran the unit tests successfully, but failed on some of the load tests. The warning provided is _Warning: only a part of test result was loaded because test type implementation is not available_. If I try to open the test, I get a message box saying _There are no Test Result Details available_.

Google fails to provide any insight into this error.

![Load Test Results Error][0]

Anyone come across this before?
