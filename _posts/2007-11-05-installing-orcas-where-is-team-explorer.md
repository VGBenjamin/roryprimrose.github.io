This was an interesting one. I just installed Orcas Team Suite Beta 2. I would have assumed that Team Suite was the complete package. Everything I needed. Nope, not quite. Team Explorer is missing. 

To get Team Explorer, you have to run the setup package for Team Foundation Server in order to then install the Team Explorer client software. Does this sound right. Having to run a server installer to get access to client software???
