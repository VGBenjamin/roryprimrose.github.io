I have a new machine at work that is a nice beefy machine. It has eight cores and 12Gb of RAM. I was a bit surprised to see that a load test I was running was maxing out the CPU.![image][0]

It's a shame that I only have one core being used for the load test. It would be great if I could really load up this code base on all eight cores.
