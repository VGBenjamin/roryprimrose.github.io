I built a windows service application for work as a piece of my latest projects large puzzle. One of the annoying things about developing windows services is that debugging them as they start is a big problem. My windows service didn't suffer from this because it didn't do anything straight away which gave me time to get my fingers hooked into it. Other people at work however did get their service to start work immediately. Debugging their application caused them no small amount of grief.  
  
 Paul Ballard just [posted an entry][0] (following on from Mike Diehl's [post][1]) about how to debug windows services from the start. Well worth the read if you have been bitten by this.
