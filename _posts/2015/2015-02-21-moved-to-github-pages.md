I've been running this blog on the Microsoft stack since way back in August 2001 with almost 900 posts. I think that might have even been before blogging was called blogging. My viewpoint on blog engines has changed substantially over the years to the point where the bells and whistles of the 'modern' blog engines are not as attractive as they once were.

I've now converted the blog over to Jekyll using GitHub pages to make my blogging life a lot easier. As part of this process, I have removed a whole lot of old posts and files that are no longer relevant to the current state of technology. This blog now has half the posts it once was and is much more technology focused.
