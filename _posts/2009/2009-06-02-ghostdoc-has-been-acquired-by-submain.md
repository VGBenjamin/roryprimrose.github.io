Just like [Reflector][0], [SubMain][1] has just acquired [GhostDoc][2] and has released an updated version. Looks like SubMain has already put in a decent amount of effort for GhostDoc. This is appears to be significantly different in contrast to what [Red Gate][3] has published for Reflector. Looks like it will be interesting times ahead for these tools.
