I just read on [Guy Bursteinâ€™s][0] blog that WF 4.0 introduces a WorkflowInvoker class. This class makes it much easier to execute synchronous workflows without having to write all the plumbing code required by the WorkflowInstance class. This is really great news. See [this post][1] for the details.
