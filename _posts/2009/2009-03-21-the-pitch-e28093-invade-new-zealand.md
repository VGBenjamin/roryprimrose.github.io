I just saw the first episode in the latest season of the [Gruen Transfer][0]. The concept of the show is classic and the idea of “The pitch” is simply gold. 

Watching this episode reminded me of a pitch from last year about selling the idea of invading New Zealand. My favourite was the advert that lost the competition, but I just have to link to it for posterity.
