What is the difference between [geeks][0] and [nerds][1]?

I have heard this one hit around a few times in the last couple of years. If I have to pick one of these for myself, I would say I was a geek rather than a nerd. Nerd just doesn't seem to fit. Not that I have anything against nerds, but I can't stand it if someone calls me a nerd. Geek isn't so bad, but I would prefer not to be called either.

To fit my view of the world, I like to think that geek = nerd + social skills. To counter that, my wife says (in jest) that geek = nerd - intelligence.

What's your view?

BTW, she also said that putting this question out to the blogging community is a bit of a skewed sample, so you should also ask any non geek/nerds in your life. [:D]
