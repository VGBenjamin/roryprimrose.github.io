A very interesting [announcement][0] came out overnight. [Scott Guthrie][1] announced that Microsoft is releasing some of the code of the .Net base class library for the 3.5 framework. License agreement is [here][2] with an important note highlighted [here][3]. This has only been previously possible with tools like [Reflector][4] which is view only and doesnâ€™t allow debugger support.
