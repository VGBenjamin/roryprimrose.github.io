We have been looking at coding standards recently. The hottest topic so far seems to be around the prefix used (if any) of member level variables. The current choices are:

1. m_ such as m_Name or m_name
1. _ such as _name
1. [None] such as Name or name
I have my personal opinion which I shall reserve for the sake of this post. Arghhh! Can't resist. I vote #2.

Which do you align with? Why? Are there others that should be considered?
