This is great news - [My Technobabble : IServiceLocator a step toward IoC container / Service locator detente][0]. This diverse group of people have been able to collaborate to create a common interface to use for IoC container / Service locator frameworks. Hopefully the adoption rate will be swift by the creators of the IoC frameworks. Congratulations guys, this is a great achievement.

It would be good to see the same outcome for a common logging interface.
