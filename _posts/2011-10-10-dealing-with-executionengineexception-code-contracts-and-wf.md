I recently battled the scary ExecutionEngineException. Itâ€™s scary because the exception itself does not provide any information about what has gone wrong and why. Figuring out why the exception is being thrown can get a little tricky.

In my scenario, Visual Studio was crashing when trying to display a WF designer. After attaching another Visual Studio instance to debug the crash, I found that the exception being thrown in the designer was ExecutionEngineException. The place it was being thrown was in an evaluation of a Code Contract (Requires&lt;ArgumentNullException&gt;). I quickly realised that I had added some code contracts into my WF design assembly but not enabled the code contract rewriter for compiling the assembly. Rather than throwing an ArgumentNullException for a given condition, the contract was not correctly written into the assembly and the framework threw ExecutionEngineException instead.

The ExecutionEngineException appears to be a fairly low level exception. Unfortunately its use in Code Contracts is confusing because of the lack of information about what is going wrong and how the developer should fix it.
