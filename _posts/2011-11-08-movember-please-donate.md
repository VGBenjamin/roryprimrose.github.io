It’s not often that I post something personal on this blog. [Movember][0] is an important cause so I’ll make an exception.

> It's Movember and time to focus on men's health. To show my commitment, I'm donating my face to the cause by growing a moustache for the entire month of November, and need your support. My Mo will spark conversations, and no doubt generate some laughs; all in the name of raising vital awareness and funds for prostate cancer and male depression.

> Why am I so passionate about men's health?   
> * 1 in 9 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime   
> * This year 20,000 new cases of the disease will be diagnosed   
> * 1 in 8 men will experience depression in their lifetime

> I'm asking you to support my Movember campaign by making a donation by either:   
> * Donating online at: [http://www.movember.com/m/2443216][0]  
> * Writing a cheque payable to 'Movember', referencing my Registration ID: 2443216 and mailing it to: Movember, PO Box 60, East Melbourne, VIC, 8002, Australia

> If you'd like to find out more about the type of work you'd be helping to fund by supporting Movember, take a look at the Programs We Fund section on the Movember website: [http://au.movember.com/about][1]

> Thank you in advance for supporting my efforts to change the face of men's health.
