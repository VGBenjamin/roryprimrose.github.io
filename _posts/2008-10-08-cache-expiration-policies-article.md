I was asked recently about caching expiration policies in response to my rant in my [Caching should not be the source of truth][0] post and a comment I made in a [post][1] by [Chris Blankenship][2]. I have written an article about cache expiration policies which you can find [here][3]. It discusses the high level concepts in expiration polices and some suggestions about which options to pick. It makes references to HttpRuntime.Cache and the Caching Application Block in EntLib.
