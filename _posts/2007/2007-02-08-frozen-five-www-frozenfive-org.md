As my wife and I were traveling through New Zealand last year, we were fortunate enough to met a great Swedish couple (Anna-Lisa and Mats) who we were able to travel with for a few days. On the 29th of March, Mats is going to start a Svalbard Skiing Expedition with a [group of other geoscience students][0] from around the world.
