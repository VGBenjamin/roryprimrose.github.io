Every now and then, and sometime more often than that, I happened to not have my fingers on the right keys. The results are usually terrible, but can sometimes be kinda cool. I just tried typing "similar" and came up with "sunukar" instead. Maybe that should be the name of my next piece of software. 

Following in one of the trends of Microsoft, I have been naming software according to town names. Could this be the new method of generating code names? Just bash the keyboard in semi-random positions.
