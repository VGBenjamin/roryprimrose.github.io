I was doing some reading a while ago about digital certificates. The kind of certificate I was after was so that I could use HTTPS in IIS. It looked like the certificates were all very expensive for what they are. I finally came across a post that referred to StartCom. These guys offer free digital certificates for domain or email validation. At this stage, the only hitch is that the CA certificate is not on client machines by default, but can be installed from the StartCom site.
