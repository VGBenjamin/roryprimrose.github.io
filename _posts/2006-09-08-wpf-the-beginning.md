In my new job, I have been tasked with the great opportunity of building a prototype application in WPF. The .Net 3.0 RC1 came out last weekend so I have been using these latest bits. It has been a very interesting experience getting my hands dirty with WPF, but it has been difficult for the last few days without VS integration. Thankfully, the extensions for VS2005 came out last night. Grab them [here][0].
